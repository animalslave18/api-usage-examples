## Ethereum smart contract operations on EthVigil ã€‰Supported by live Websocket updates

### Pre-requisites

To run this code, you need:
* Python 3.6+
* [Install EthVigil Python SDK.](https://github.com/blockvigil/ethvigil-python-sdk) Follow the instructions.

### Running the code

Open up your favorite terminal, and just run this at the prompt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python deploy.py
```

### What does the code demonstrate?


* Instantiation of EthVigil SDK instance, `EVCore`
* Setting up a Websocket client (in a child thread) to register with EthVigil Websocket notifications and receive contract activity updates
* Deployment of a smart contract, [`microblog.sol`](./microblog.sol)
* Await Websocket confirmation for contract deployment transaction from EthVigil
* Write to the deployed contract. Call `addPost()` via autogenerated API endpoint against contract function.
* Await Websocket confirmation for above transaction from EthVigil

#### Why not use Ethereum PubSub API?

* Your code does not need to filter through the entire stream of Websocket updates sent from the PubSub mechanism of your local Ethereum client or Infura.

* You receive Websocket updates only corresponding to activity on contracts registered through EthVigil. Can be further controlled through subscriptions.

* No missing updates
